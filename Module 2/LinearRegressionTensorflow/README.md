# Kaggle Project: Boston Housing Dataset

Welcome to my Kaggle project on the Boston Housing dataset. In this project, I explore and analyze housing values in the suburbs of Boston, with the goal of understanding the factors that influence median home values.

## Description

### Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston

The "medv" variable is the target variable, representing the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

## Dataset Overview

The Boston dataset contains the following attributes:

- **crim**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **zn**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **indus**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **chas**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
- **nox**: Nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- **rm**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **age**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **dis**: Weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers.
- **rad**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- **tax**: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
- **ptratio**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **black**: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
- **lstat**: Lower status of the population (percent).
- **medv**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

## Project Goals

- Explore the dataset to gain insights into the factors affecting housing prices in Boston.
- Preprocess and clean the data as needed for analysis.
- Apply machine learning techniques, such as regression, to build predictive models for housing prices.
- Evaluate the performance of the models and identify key features that influence housing values.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary libraries
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
3. Go to the correct path and run `python3 LinearRegression.py` script to train the Logistic Regression model and make predictions.
